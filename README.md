Vote-Based Discussion Forum
Sites like Reddit, HackerNews and others offer a collection of different pages or forums where users may post news, pictures, and other information around a certain topic. Other users can then upvote or downvote content. The more upvotes an item receives, the higher it's displayed on the list. Recreate a basic subreddit and/or vote-based discussion board using React and Redux. Here are some user stories to get you started:

- enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
- new posts to include a timestamp.
- see when other listings were posted
- upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
- downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
- I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page.
  (We haven't explicitly covered this in our curriculum, but here's a hint: You can complete logic before the return statement of a mapStateToProps() method!)

  Further Exploration

- click a post to view additional details. For now simply hide/show some message content.
  (Hint: You could create a currentlySelectedPost Redux state key, and alter the value based on which post the user is selecting.)
